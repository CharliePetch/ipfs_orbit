# Cloudflare Quick Tunnel detection + IPNS endpoint publishing.
#
# On startup, spawns a daemon thread that:
#   1. Polls cloudflared's metrics endpoint to discover the tunnel URL
#   2. Writes the URL into public.json["endpoint"]
#   3. Publishes public.json to IPFS and the CID to IPNS
#   4. Re-checks every 60s to detect URL changes (e.g., after cloudflared restart)
