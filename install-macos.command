# Cipher Station — one-click macOS installer (double-clickable .command).
#
# Installs IPFS (Kubo) + cloudflared, sets up the Python environment, initializes
# a dedicated IPFS repo, registers launchd services for the IPFS daemon, the
# Cipher Station station, the Cloudflare tunnel, and the menu bar app — then starts them.
#
# No sudo required: binaries land in ~/.cipherstation/bin and services run as LaunchAgents
# in your user session.
#
# Optional environment variables (both unset == the historical layout, unchanged):
#
#   CIPHER_DATA_ROOT    Absolute path to a mounted volume that should hold all
#                       station state. On macOS this is typically an external or
#                       secondary drive under /Volumes, e.g.:
#                         CIPHER_DATA_ROOT=/Volumes/CipherData ./install-macos.command
#                       When set:   IPFS repo    -> $CIPHER_DATA_ROOT/ipfs
#                                   station data -> $CIPHER_DATA_ROOT/station
#                       When unset: IPFS repo    -> ~/.cipherstation/ipfs
#                                   station data -> <repo>/cipher_station_data
#
#   CIPHER_STORAGE_MAX  Optional IPFS datastore cap, e.g. "25GB". Applied on every
#                       run. Unset leaves kubo's own default alone.
